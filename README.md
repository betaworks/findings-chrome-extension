====================
Installation and use
====================

For now you'll need to install the this as an unpacked extension in
Chrome. Visit `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer Mode, and click
`Load unpacked extension`. Then navigate to the directory of this extension
and Chrome will do the rest.

When you have text selected in Chrome, the right-click context menu will
give you the option of submitting the selected text to Findings.

This all works, apart from the submission to Findings part :-) I just made
up the URL for a submission to them. Probably submission will have to be
via a POST, not a GET with the clipping text in the URL.
